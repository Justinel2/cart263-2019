For more than 25 years, rich countries shipped their plastic trash to poorer Asian countries.
In 2016, China imported two thirds of the world’s plastic waste. On December 31, 2017, China declared
its "National Sword" policy that disrupted the global market. It bans a proportion of materials and
sets new standards for imports of recyclable material. (National Geographic)

I AM NOT AGAINST RECYCLING (2019)  is a JavaScript/Jquery game that seeks to simply portray the Western
recycling process and its value/meaning. More precisely, this small game compares this process to the
Myth of Sisyphus.

Recycling has been around for thousands of years. Even so, it seems like its introduction
was made with the environmental movement of the 1970s. Through the years, the awareness about the
alarming global ecological situation increased. Individuals are informed and pushed toward more sustainable ways to live; and recycling has been promoted as the basic action one need to take to save the planet in response of our overconsumption. Yet, can saving the planet be done from our homes? Who is to blame? This question does not aim to remove or diminish our responsibility to individually adopt sustainable habits; it wants to investigate our level of responsibility as individuals, part of a system.

So, I AM NOT AGAINST RECYCLING simulates our process of sorting and discarting trash. To “win” the game,
the user needs to wash and recycle the recyclable items and to throw the other ones in the trash.
Lost or won, the game finishes the same: on an actual picture of recycling being dumped amongst trash
in the United States (CBS). Like the game, the recycling and trash often finishes at the same place
because of nations lacking capacities to manage such amount of waste. The game recalls the Myth of
Sisyphus, where there is labour expecting a promessed outcome that cannot seem to be achieved.

So, like in real life, the user is first encouraged to feel satisfaction and gratification towards
recycling. At the end, the game suggests that the user’s labor was for nothing. The objective is to
create a discussion about accountability. Before changing the world with our individual actions, there
is the need for novelty;  novelty in the way we think about consumption, sustainability and
accountability.

Thus, I am not against recycling. I just think that through its promotion, portrayed as THE solution,
the blame was given to individuals, families and homes, while often exempting the fault to the
individuals and groups in position of power that dictate our world.
