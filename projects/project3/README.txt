HOLY
By Justine Lardeux

  For His eyes are upon the ways of a man, And He sees all his steps. (BIBLE, New International Version, Job 34:21)
The term “ubiquity” is a word that has first known been used in the 1570s. The noun comes from Modern Latin ubiquitas which is from Latin ubique (“everywhere”). It can be decomposed from Latin ubi and que; ubi means “where, in which place, in what place”, while que means “any, also, and, ever”. (Online Etymology Dictionary) Ubiquity was first used to describe the omnipresence of God in Christianism, it is now used to talk about new media and new networks.

  HOLY  is based on the concept of Ubiquity in New Media. More precisely, it refers to omnipresence and the Holy qualities that The Cloud possess. It bases itself on Deleuze societies of control, extending on Foucault disciplinary societies. The idea is to portray three layers, such as the visible, the invisible and the sensed. 

  When the program starts the users is in the visible layer. They are prompt to input their name, age and location. The program will not start if the users enters an empty or unchanged input. After submitting valid identifications, they are introduced to a mystical entity, a sphere with a robotic voice. After their consent (on a vague premise), the entity interviews the users with random questions to “get to know them”. After each question, the entity listens and wait until the user says ‘done’ to ask another one. 

  This layer is called visible because it seeks to represent the everyday embodiment of The Cloud. The Cloud basically symbolizes the internet through cloud computing. Yet, the name indicate ubiquitous qualities; Like the Holy Spirit, the Cloud seems to reside symbolically in the sky, in the air, everywhere in space and in time. The interview is basically a confessional, a way to prompt data from the user. It also illustrate Deleuze concept of open space, in which the watchman can ubiquitously surveil the prisoners to monitor and control them. 

  The invisible layer can be reached by hovering on the entity. Its body zooms to portray the rough data, underneath reassuring the womanly voice and visuals. Every written or oral user answers are displayed in a single paragraph. It seeks to show the invisible facet of the watchman, of the Cloud, of the Holy Christ; they seem to adopt the same role in these different stories. Yet, the Cloud distinguishes itself in its capacity to store information in a scale and quality that would be impossible to a mere human watchman. But, certain humans are in control of the holy knowledge. In that case, it is me, the architect of the program. 

The last layer can be reached through scrolling down the screen. To see underneath the surface (in that case, the skin-like water), is to see the internal effects of the process. To extend the idea of monitoring and control, the user are confronted to iterations of recordings staring them. The recordings are the ones of their answers and can be unexpected. The objective is to confuse and overwhelm the users so they respond differently while and after noticing they are being recorded.
